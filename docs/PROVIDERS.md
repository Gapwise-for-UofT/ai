# AI provider integration

Gapwise AI intentionally exposes one standards-based remote MCP endpoint rather than provider-specific backends:

```text
https://ai.gapwise.ca/api/mcp
```

Protected-resource metadata:

```text
https://ai.gapwise.ca/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
```

The MCP surface is the product contract. Provider packaging must not duplicate timetable, routing, gap-planning, permission, or write-validation logic.

## Claude

Claude custom connectors target the same remote Streamable HTTP MCP service and OAuth boundary. Use the canonical MCP URL above.

Release test:

1. Add the remote connector from Claude's connector settings.
2. Complete Gapwise/Supabase OAuth and approve the exact client on the Gapwise consent screen.
3. In Gapwise, explicitly enable AI delegation and only the permissions needed for the test.
4. Verify `get_ai_delegation_status` succeeds.
5. Verify `get_my_day` returns exact source-backed meetings and no undelegated personal data.
6. If gap-plan sharing is enabled, verify `get_my_gap_plan` preserves Gapwise's deterministic route status/confidence and timing fields exactly.
7. With write permissions still off, verify write tools fail closed.
8. Enable gap-preference write permission, queue a bounded preference update, then open Gapwise and verify the action is validated/applied and the subsequent read reflects a newer snapshot revision.
9. Verify imported academic meetings cannot be edited through any exposed tool.
10. Revoke AI access in Gapwise and verify the connector can no longer retrieve delegated data.

Provider-specific callback URLs and client-registration behavior are external-client details and must be rechecked against the provider's current documentation during each release validation. Do not hard-code a provider credential into this repository.

## ChatGPT

The same canonical MCP endpoint is the underlying Gapwise integration backend; do not create a separate ChatGPT data API.

For private development on a ChatGPT plan/workspace that currently supports custom MCP apps:

1. Enable the product's current developer/custom-app flow for the eligible workspace/account.
2. Create a custom app and supply `https://ai.gapwise.ca/api/mcp`.
3. Let the client scan the registered MCP tools and complete OAuth when prompted.
4. Exercise the same read/write/revocation matrix used for other external clients.
5. Pay particular attention to confirmation UX for destructive/write actions and to refresh-token longevity.

Public distribution should wrap the same MCP backend in the current ChatGPT app submission flow rather than introducing a second server implementation.

Before submission, require:

- a stable HTTPS production endpoint;
- successful OAuth discovery and refresh behavior;
- a public, accurate Gapwise privacy policy covering AI delegation;
- clear tool names/descriptions and correct MCP safety annotations;
- no undeclared data collection or logging of timetable/tool payloads;
- deterministic source-of-truth behavior for schedule/routing/gap facts;
- explicit permission and revocation UX;
- end-to-end tests for reads, queued writes, stale-revision rejection, and academic immutability.

## Other MCP clients

Any client supporting the required remote Streamable HTTP MCP and authorization flow may target the same endpoint. Treat each new provider as a compatibility/security validation exercise, not a reason to fork the backend.

For every provider, validate at minimum:

- protected-resource and OAuth discovery;
- client-registration behavior expected by that client;
- access-token refresh/expiry behavior;
- `client_id` preservation in Supabase OAuth access tokens where required by the current authorization policy;
- RLS isolation from primary Gapwise private/cloud/friend data;
- tool-schema compatibility;
- write confirmation UX where the client provides it;
- disconnect/revocation behavior.

## Release rule

A provider is not considered supported merely because it can list the tools. It is supported only after a real OAuth session has passed the read, permission-denial, write, stale-revision, academic-immutability, and revocation tests against production-equivalent Gapwise data.
